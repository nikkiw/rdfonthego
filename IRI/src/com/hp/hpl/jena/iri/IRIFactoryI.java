 * This interface is used for

 * <li>Without
 * resolving against a base (by the class {@link IRIFactory}). 
 * <li>By resolving against a base (by the interface
 * {@link IRI}).
 * </ol>
 * Which properties of the IRIs result in errors or
 * warnings is determined by the 
 * current settings of the underlying {@link IRIFactory},
 * which is the factory object being used in the first
 * case, or the factory object used to create the base
 * IRI in the second case.
